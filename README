INTRODUCTION

 HotSwap provides a robust API for facilitating dynamic class
 recompilation & reloading and object state migration throughout the
 life of an application, otherwise known as "hotswapping". Hotswapping
 makes Java feel more like an interpreted language than a compiled
 language; it is fundamentally useful for so-called "dynamic
 application development".

REQUIREMENTS

 JDK1.2 for basic use, JDK1.3 for full use.

INSTALLATION
 
 Put the jar in your classpath.

LICENSE
 
 GPL

DOCUMENTATION

 The documentation is the Javadocs.  The package description of
 org.inxar.hotswap is the hotswap manual.  Make sure you read this.

EXAMPLES

 The helloworld script in the bin directory can be used to run the
 helloworld example.  It calls the example.RunExample class with
 arguments that configure it to watch the ./examples/HelloWorld file.
 Take a look at the script to get an idea what it does.  Run the
 script from THIS directory (ie the filenames are relative):

  ./bin/helloworld.sh

 The RunExample class will start a Thread that will watch for changes
 to the HelloWorld.java file.  While the example is running, you
 should open HelloWorld.java in an editor and make changes to it and
 see the effects.

 [Windows users]: You may need to edit or implement a better
 helloworld.bat file.  I haven't really tested it under a purely
 Windows environment.

BUGS

 /please report bugs/ (or bugfixes) to [pcj@inxar.org] so that I can
 fix them for future releases to the Java community.  Thanks!
